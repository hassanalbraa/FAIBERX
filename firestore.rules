/**
 * This ruleset enforces a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * Access is primarily determined by a user's role. A user is considered an 'Admin'
 * if a corresponding document exists for them in the `/roles_admin` collection.
 * This approach centralizes role management and simplifies security logic.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: A top-level collection containing all product data.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: A collection where the existence of a document
 *   with a user's UID as the ID grants them administrative privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin-Only Writes: All write operations (create, update, delete) on products
 *   are strictly limited to authenticated users with the 'Admin' role.
 * - Controlled Public Reads: Any user (authenticated or not) can read an
 *   individual product document if they know its ID (`get`). However, listing the
 *   entire collection of products (`list`) is restricted to Admins to prevent
 *   data scraping.
 * - Locked Admin Roles: The `/roles_admin` collection is not writeable from the
 *   client. This is a critical security measure ensuring that admin roles can only
 *   be assigned through the Firebase Console or a trusted server-side process.
